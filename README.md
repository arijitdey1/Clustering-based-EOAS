# Clustering-based-EOAS
Implemenation of Clustering based EOAS
we propose a hybrid meta-heuristic FS method using clustering based Equilibrium Optimization (EO) and Atom Search Optimization (ASO) algorithms abbreviated as CEOAS algorithm. After reducing the feature dimension, the optimal feature subset is fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers. Here, the combination of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC) based feature vectors is considered as the input features, and these features are optimized by using the proposed CEOAS algorithm.

The file feature extraction.py contains the code for feature extraction using LPC and LPCC.
