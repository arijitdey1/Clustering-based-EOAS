We are very sorry for the inconvenience. Here we added the repository details.
1. The initial stage is feature extraction. We have used LPC and LPCC feature extraction technique. The file named LPC.py and LPCC.py consist of the codes for the feature extraction.
2. The second stage is Feature selection. For FS task we have used clustering instead of random population generation. The code of clustering is in the file named Clustering.py
3. The third stage is to use of Atom search optimization algorithm and Equilibrium optimization. The code of those two optimization algorithm is in the file named ASO.py and EO.py
4. The final stage is AWCM and SOPF and code of this stage is in the file AWCM.py
